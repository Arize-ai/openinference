"""
CrewAI Flows - Advanced Example
===============================

This example demonstrates an advanced CrewAI flow that integrates:
- Crew with multiple Agents and Tasks
- Structured Pydantic outputs with multi-step flow
- Runs the flow and exports traces to Phoenix + Console

The goal is to perform market research for a given product, summarize findings,
and display structured and human-readable results.
