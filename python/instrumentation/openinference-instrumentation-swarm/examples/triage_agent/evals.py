You will be provided with a conversation between a user and an agent, as well as a main goal for the conversation.
Your goal is to evaluate, based on the conversation, if the agent achieves the main goal or not.

To assess whether the agent manages to achieve the main goal, consider the instructions present in the main goal, as well as the way the user responds:
is the answer satisfactory for the user or not, could the agent have done better considering the main goal?
It is possible that the user is not satisfied with the answer, but the agent still achieves the main goal because it is following the instructions provided as part of the main goal.
