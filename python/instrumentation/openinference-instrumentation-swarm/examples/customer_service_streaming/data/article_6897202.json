{"text": "A RateLimitError indicates that you have hit your assigned rate limit. This means that you have sent too many tokens or requests in a given period of time, and our services have temporarily blocked you from sending more.\n\n\n\nWe impose rate limits to ensure fair and efficient use of our resources and to prevent abuse or overload of our services.\n\n\n\nIf you encounter a RateLimitError, please try the following steps:\n\n\n\n- Wait until your rate limit resets (one minute) and retry your request. The error message should give you a sense of your usage rate and permitted usage. \n\n\n- Send fewer tokens or requests or slow down. You may need to reduce the frequency or volume of your requests, batch your tokens, or implement exponential backoff. You can read our rate limit guidance [here](https://help.openai.com/en/articles/6891753-rate-limit-advice).\n\n\n- You can also check your usage statistics from your account dashboard.\n\n\n", "title": "RateLimitError", "article_id": "6897202", "url": "https://help.openai.com/en/articles/6897202-ratelimiterror"}
