{"text": "When you get the error message:\n\n\n\n\n```\nIncorrect API key provided: API_KEY*********************************ZXY. You can find your API key at https://beta.openai.com\n```\n\n\nHere are a few simple steps you can take to resolve this issue.\n\n\n\nStep 1: Clear your browser's cache\n\n\nThe first step is to clear your browser's cache. Sometimes, your browser may hold onto an outdated version of your API key, which can cause this error message to appear. To clear your browser's cache, follow the instructions for your specific browser:\n\n\n* For Google Chrome, click on the three dots in the top-right corner of the browser and select \"History.\" Then, click on \"Clear browsing data\" and select \"Cookies and other site data\" and \"Cached images and files.\"\n* For Firefox, click on the three lines in the top-right corner of the browser and select \"Options.\" Then, click on \"Privacy & Security\" and scroll down to \"Cookies and Site Data.\" Click on \"Clear Data\" and select \"Cookies and Site Data\" and \"Cached Web Content.\"\n* For Safari, click on \"Safari\" in the top menu bar and select \"Preferences.\" Then, click on the \"Privacy\" tab and click on \"Manage Website Data.\" Select \"Remove All\" to clear your browser's cache.\n\nStep 2: Retry your request\n\n\nAfter clearing your browser's cache, try your request again. If the error message still appears, then move to the next step.\n\n\n\nStep 3: Check your API key\n\n\nCheck your API key at **[https://beta.openai.com](https://beta.openai.com/)** and verify it with the API key shown in the error message. Sometimes, the error message may include an old or incorrect API key that you no longer use. Double-check that you are using the correct API key for the request you're making.\n\n\n\nStep 4: Verify that you're not using two different API keys\n\n\nAnother possibility is that you may have accidentally used two different API keys. Make sure that you are using the same API key throughout your application or script and not switching between different keys.\n\n\n\nIf you still need help please reach out to our support team, and they will assist you with resolving the issue.\n\n\n  \n\u200b\n\n\n\n", "title": "Incorrect API key provided", "article_id": "6882433", "url": "https://help.openai.com/en/articles/6882433-incorrect-api-key-provided"}
