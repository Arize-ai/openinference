  "text": "**Introducing the GPT Store and ChatGPT Team plan (Jan 10, 2024)**\n------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n\n#### Discover what\u2019s trending in the GPT Store\n\n\nThe store features a diverse range of GPTs developed by our partners and the community. Browse popular and trending GPTs on the community leaderboard, with categories like DALL\u00b7E, writing, research, programming, education, and lifestyle. \n\n\n\nExplore GPTs at chat.openai.com/gpts.\n\n\n#### Use ChatGPT alongside your team\n\n\nWe\u2019re launching a new ChatGPT plan for teams of all sizes, which provides a secure, collaborative workspace to get the most out of ChatGPT at work. \n\n\n\nChatGPT Team offers access to our advanced models like GPT-4 and DALL\u00b7E 3, and tools like Advanced Data Analysis. It additionally includes a dedicated collaborative workspace for your team and admin tools for team management. As with ChatGPT Enterprise, you own and control your business data \u2014 we do not train on your business data or conversations, and our models don\u2019t learn from your usage. More details on our data privacy practices can be found on our [privacy page](https://openai.com/enterprise-privacy) and [Trust Portal](https://trust.openai.com/).\n\n\n\nYou can learn more about the ChatGPT Team plan [here](https://openai.com/chatgpt/team).\n\n\n\n**ChatGPT with voice is available to all users (November 21, 2023)**\n--------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n\nChatGPT with voice is now available to all free users.

Learn more [here](https://openai.com/blog/introducing-gpts).\n\n\n\nWe\u2019re rolling out custom versions of ChatGPT that you can create for a specific purpose\u2014called GPTs. GPTs are a new way for anyone to create a tailored version of ChatGPT to be more helpful in their daily life, at specific tasks, at work, or at home\u2014and then share that creation with others. For example, GPTs can help you [learn the rules to any board game, help teach your kids math, or design stickers](https://openai.com/chatgpt#do-more-with-gpts). \n\n\n\nPlus and Enterprise users can start creating GPTs this week. Later this month, we\u2019ll launch the GPT Store, so people can feature and make money from their GPTs. We plan to offer GPTs to more users soon.\n\n\n\n**Browsing is now out of beta (October 17, 2023)**\n--------------------------------------------------\n\n\nBrowsing, which we re-launched a few weeks ago, is moving out of beta.\n\n\n\nPlus and Enterprise users no longer need to switch the beta toggle to use browse, and are able to choose \"Browse with Bing\" from the GPT-4 model selector.\n\n\n\n**DALL\u00b7E 3 is now rolling out in beta (October 16, 2023)**\n----------------------------------------------------------\n\n\nWe\u2019ve integrated DALL\u00b7E 3 with ChatGPT, allowing it to respond to your requests with images. From a simple sentence to a detailed paragraph, ask ChatGPT what you want to see and it will translate your ideas into exceptionally accurate images.\n\n\n\nTo use DALL\u00b7E 3 on both web and mobile, choose DALL\u00b7E 3 in the selector under GPT-4. The message limit may vary based on capacity.\n\n\n\n**Browsing is rolling back out to Plus users (September 27, 2023)**\n-------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n\nBrowsing is rolling out to all Plus users. ChatGPT can now browse the internet to provide you with current and authoritative information, complete with direct links to sources. It is no longer limited to data before September 2021. \n\n\n\nTo try it out, enable Browsing in your beta features setting.\n\n\n* Click on 'Profile & Settings\u2019\n* Select 'Beta features'\n* Toggle on \u2018Browse with Bing\u2019\n\nChoose Browse with Bing in the selector under GPT-4.\n\n\n\n**New voice and image capabilities in ChatGPT (September 25, 2023)**\n--------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n\nWe are beginning to roll out new voice and image capabilities in ChatGPT. They offer a new, more intuitive type of interface by allowing you to have a voice conversation or show ChatGPT what you\u2019re talking about. Learn more [here](https://openai.com/blog/chatgpt-can-now-see-hear-and-speak).\n\n\n#### Voice (Beta) is now rolling out to Plus users on iOS and Android\n\n\nYou can now use voice to engage in a back-and-forth conversation with your agent.

Then, tap the headphone button located in the top-right corner of the home screen and choose your preferred voice out of five different voices.\n\n\n#### Image input will be generally available to Plus users on all platforms\n\n\nYou can now show ChatGPT one or more images. Troubleshoot why your grill won\u2019t start, explore the contents of your fridge to plan a meal, or analyze a complex graph for work-related data. To focus on a specific part of the image, you can use the drawing tool in our mobile app.\n\n\n\nTo get started, tap the photo button to capture or choose an image. You can also discuss multiple images or use our drawing tool to guide your agent.\n\n\n\n**ChatGPT language support - Alpha on web (September 11, 2023)**\n----------------------------------------------------------------\n\n\nChatGPT now supports a limited selection of languages in the interface: \n\n\n* Chinese (zh-Hans)\n* Chinese (zh-TW)\n* French (fr-FR)\n* German (de-DE)\n* Italian (it-IT)\n* Japanese (ja-JP)\n* Portuguese (pt-BR)\n* Russian (ru-RU)\n* Spanish (es-ES)\n\nIf you've configured your browser to use one of these supported languages, you'll see a banner in ChatGPT that enables you to switch your language settings.
