{"text": "While the OpenAI website is only available in English, you can use our models in other languages as well. The models are optimized for use in English, but many of them are robust enough to generate good results for a variety of languages.\n\n\n\nWhen thinking about how to adapt our models to different languages, we recommend starting with one of our pre-made prompts, such as this [English to French](https://beta.openai.com/examples/default-translate) prompt example. By replacing the English input and French output with the language you'd like to use, you can create a new prompt customized to your language.\n\n\n\nIf you write your prompt to in Spanish, you're more likely to receive a response in Spanish. We'd recommend experimenting to see what you can achieve with the models!\n\n", "title": "How do I use the OpenAI API in different languages?", "article_id": "6742369", "url": "https://help.openai.com/en/articles/6742369-how-do-i-use-the-openai-api-in-different-languages"}
