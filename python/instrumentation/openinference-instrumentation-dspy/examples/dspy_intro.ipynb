    "This notebook introduces the **DSPy** framework for **Programming with Foundation Models**, i.e., language models (LMs) and retrieval models (RMs).\n",
    "\n",
    "**DSPy** emphasizes programming over prompting. It unifies techniques for **prompting** and **fine-tuning** LMs as well as improving them with **reasoning** and **tool/retrieval augmentation**, all expressed through a _minimalistic set of Pythonic operations that compose and learn_.\n",
    "\n",
    "**DSPy** provides **composable and declarative modules** for instructing LMs in a familiar Pythonic syntax. On top of that, **DSPy** introduces an **automatic compiler that teaches LMs** how to conduct the declarative steps in your program. The **DSPy compiler** will internally _trace_ your program and then **craft high-quality prompts for large LMs (or train automatic finetunes for small LMs)** to teach them the steps of your task."

    "As we'll start to see below, **DSPy** can routinely teach powerful models like `GPT-3.5` and local models like `T5-base` or `Llama2-13b` to be much more reliable at complex tasks. **DSPy** will compile the _same program_ into different few-shot prompts and/or finetunes for each LM.\n",

    "Let's begin by setting things up. The snippet below will also install **DSPy** if it's not there already."
