        proposes a generic architecture for a knowl- edge base management system (KBMS)
        and describes a body of results addressing issues that range from storage
        management, query processing and concurrency control to rule processing. The
        proposed system offers a rich rep- resentational framework including structuring
        mechanisms (generalization, aggregation, classification and others), as well
        as an assertion language for expressing deductive rules and integrity constraints.
        Moreover, the system supports reasoning mechanisms, including deductive inference,
        con- straint enforcement and temporal reasoning. The represen- tation language
        adopted for the KBMS design is Telos (Mylopoulos et al. 1990).   The term
        \u201Cknowledge base\u201D is used throughout the paper, instead of \u201Cdatabase\u201D,
        mostly for historical reasons. There are no technical grounds for distinguishing
        between the two terms, in view of the fact that (extended) database systems
        (such as ones managing object-oriented, active and deductive databases) do
        support some deductive and non-deductive in- ference mechanisms and structuring
        facilities analogous to those found in knowledge bases. The difference in
        meaning, if any, between the two terms is mostly in the degree to which they
        support representational, structuring and infer- ence capabilities.   \"},\"location\":{\"s3Location\":{\"uri\":\"s3://bedrock-az-kb/knowledge_bases/VLDBJ96.pdf\"},\"type\":\"S3\"}},{\"content\":{\"text\":\"The
        rest of the paper is organized as follows. Section 2 presents a brief overview
        of the knowledge representation framework of Telos. Section 3 proposes a generic
        architec- ture for a KBMS and its components. Sections 4\u20137 describe,
        respectively, research results on storage management, query processing, concurrency
        control and constraint and rule man- agement. Each one of these sections defines
        the problem in the context of knowledge bases, identifies limitations of existing
        approaches (if such exist) and proposes solutions,   along with an evaluation.
        The methodology used to evalu- ate the proposed research results varies with
        the results being evaluated. Section 8 summarizes the results of this work
        and outlines open problems for further research.   2 Overview of Telos   The
        representational framework of Telos (Mylopoulos et al. 1990) constitutes a
        generalization of graph-theoretic data structures used in semantic networks

        history time and a belief time. The history time of a proposition represents
        the lifetime of a proposition in the application domain (i.e., the lifetime

        the knowledge base and the time when its belief is terminated. Both history
        and belief time are represented by means of time intervals. The model of time
        adopted is a modification of Allen\u2019s framework (Allen 1983). Seven exclusive
        tem- poral relations (e.g., equal, meet, before, after, during, start, end
