      [\n          {\n            \"text\": \"The sky is blue because of a phenomenon
      called **Rayleigh scattering**. Here's a breakdown:\\n\\n*   **Sunlight:** Sunlight
      is actually made up of all the colors of the rainbow.\\n\\n*   **Entering the
      Atmosphere:** When sunlight enters the Earth's atmosphere, it collides with
      tiny air molecules (mostly nitrogen and oxygen).\\n\\n*   **Scattering:** This
      collision causes the sunlight to scatter in different directions.\\n\\n*   **Rayleigh
      Scattering:** Rayleigh scattering is the scattering of electromagnetic radiation
      (of which light is a form) by particles of a much smaller wavelength. In this
      case, the air molecules are much smaller than the wavelengths of visible light.\\n\\n*
      \  **Blue is Scattered More:** Shorter wavelengths of light (like blue and violet)
      are scattered more strongly than longer wavelengths (like red and orange). This
      is because the amount of scattering is inversely proportional to the fourth
      power of the wavelength. This means blue light is scattered about ten times
      more than red light.\\n\\n*   **Why Not Violet?** Violet light is scattered
      even more than blue. However, there are a couple of reasons why we see a blue
      sky:\\n    *   The sun emits less violet light than blue light.\\n    *   Our
      eyes are more sensitive to blue than violet.\\n\\n*   **The Result:** Because
      blue light is scattered more effectively, it bounces around the atmosphere more
      and reaches our eyes from all directions, making the sky appear blue.\\n\\nIn
      simpler terms, think of it like this: the air molecules are like tiny obstacles.
      When sunlight hits these obstacles, the blue light bounces off them more than
      the other colors, spreading blue light all over the sky.\\n\"\n          }\n
