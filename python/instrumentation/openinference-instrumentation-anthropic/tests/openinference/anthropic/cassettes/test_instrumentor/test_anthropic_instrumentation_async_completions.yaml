        A court case can reach the Supreme Court in a few different ways:\n\n1. Appeal
        from lower courts. Most cases that reach the Supreme Court are appeals from
        decisions at lower federal courts or state supreme courts. Typically, a party
        who loses at a lower court level can appeal the decision to the next higher
        court. After the court of appeals, the next stop is the Supreme Court.\n\n2.
        Original jurisdiction. The Supreme Court has original jurisdiction over certain
        types of cases, meaning they can hear the case directly without it coming
        from a lower court. These mainly include cases between two or more states
        or certain cases involving ambassadors and public ministers.\n\n3. Writ of
        certiorari. This a process where a party petitions the Supreme Court to hear
        an appeal from a lower court. The Supreme Court then has discretion on whether
        or not it wants to hear the case. Each term, there are thousands of petitions
        for writ of certiorari, but the court only agrees to hear argument in about
        100-150 cases per session. \n\n4. Certificate from lower courts or government.
        Sometimes a circuit court of appeals can certify a legal issue to the Supreme
        Court before making a final ruling. Government agencies can also refer cases
        or issues over which there is some uncertainty or disagreement over the correct
        legal interpretation.\n\nSo in summary, it''s usually an appeals process from
        lower courts, the court''s original jurisdiction, or the Supreme Court agreeing
        to exercise its discretion in hearing an appeal petition on a disputed legal
        issue. The type and complexity of cases it hears is very selective.","stop_reason":"stop_sequence","model":"claude-2.1","stop":"\n\nHuman:","log_id":"compl_01UXLihn1JiHdBhcGahQv7pe"}'
