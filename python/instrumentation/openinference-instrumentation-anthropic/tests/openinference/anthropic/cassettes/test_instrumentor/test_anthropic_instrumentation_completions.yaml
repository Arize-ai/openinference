        A court case can reach the Supreme Court in a few different ways:\n\n1. Appeal
        from lower courts. Most cases that reach the Supreme Court are appeals from
        decisions of federal courts of appeals or state supreme courts. Typically
        there has to be an important constitutional issue or federal law question
        for the Supreme Court to accept such an appeal.\n\n2. Original jurisdiction
        cases. The Supreme Court has original jurisdiction over certain types of cases,
        meaning they can hear the case directly without it coming from a lower court.
        These include cases between two or more U.S. states or cases involving ambassadors
        and other diplomats.\n\n3. Certiorari. This is the process by which the Supreme
        Court selects most of the cases it hears. Parties to a case petition the Court
        to review the case, and the Court grants \"cert\" if four of the nine justices
        agree to hear it. The Court typically grants certiorari in cases that have
        broad legal impact or important constitutional questions.\n\n4. Certificate
        from appeals courts. A federal appeals court can also ask the Supreme Court
        to take a case by granting a certificate of ascertainability. This happens
        when the appeals court determines there is a critical question of law that
        requires the Supreme Court''s review. \n\nSo in most cases, the Supreme Court
        exercises discretionary review via petitions for certiorari or certificates
        from lower courts. Its original jurisdiction over certain types of cases also
        allows some direct access for parties.","stop_reason":"stop_sequence","model":"claude-2.1","stop":"\n\nHuman:","log_id":"compl_01N6jAWfEZtyE338jUQFx9LC"}'
