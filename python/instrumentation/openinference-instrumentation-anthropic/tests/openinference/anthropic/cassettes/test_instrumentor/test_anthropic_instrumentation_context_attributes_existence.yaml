        A court case can reach the Supreme Court in a few different ways:\n\n1. Appeal
        from lower courts: Most cases that reach the Supreme Court are appeals from
        decisions of lower federal courts or state supreme courts. Typically, a party
        who loses in a lower court files an appeal to the next higher court, arguing
        some error occurred that warrants overturning or modifying the decision. If
        the appeals eventually reach the U.S. Supreme Court, the Court may agree to
        hear the case.\n\n2. Original jurisdiction: The Supreme Court has \"original
        jurisdiction\" over certain types of cases, meaning they can originate in
        the Supreme Court without coming from a lower court. These cases usually involve
        disputes between state governments or between the U.S. federal government
        and a state.\n\n3. Certiorari: This is the most common way cases reach the
        Supreme Court. Parties involved in cases in lower courts or state supreme
        courts can petition the U.S. Supreme Court to review their case by writing
        what''s called a \"writ of certiorari.\" The Court then chooses which cases
        to hear based on various factors - typically cases that involve important
        constitutional questions or conflict between lower court decisions.\n\n4.
        Certificate from lower appeals courts: A federal appeals court dealing with
        a case can also choose to certify a question of law and send it to the Supreme
        Court, requesting that the justices provide guidance on a point of law or
        an issue of constitutional interpretation.\n\nIn most instances, the Supreme
        Court chooses which cases it wishes to hear - it declines far more cases than
        it accepts each term. Its decisions then become part of binding federal case
        law.","stop_reason":"stop_sequence","model":"claude-2.1","stop":"\n\nHuman:","log_id":"compl_01AdXAXhzu4BANhFCctNJwDL"}'
