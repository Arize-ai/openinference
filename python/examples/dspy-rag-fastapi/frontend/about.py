    ## Description
    This project introduces a [Streamlit](https://streamlit.io) application designed to interface seamlessly with the [DSPy](https://github.com/stanfordnlp/dspy) framework by StanfordNLP, encapsulated within a [FastAPI](https://github.com/tiangolo/fastapi) backend. It offers an intuitive and interactive frontend solution, showcasing the capabilities of DSPy through a user-friendly web interface. The application leverages [Ollama](https://github.com/ollama/ollama) for language and embedding models, [Chroma DB](https://github.com/chroma-core/chroma) for vector storage, and [Arize Phoenix](https://github.com/Arize-ai/phoenix) for an observability layer.

    In a notable application of this system, the Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) process is performed on the insightful essay "What I Worked On" by Paul Graham.
