# Overview

This is a [LlamaIndex](https://www.llamaindex.ai/) project bootstrapped with [`create-llama`](https://github.com/run-llama/LlamaIndexTS/tree/main/packages/create-llama) and adapted to include OpenInference instrumentation for OpenAI calls.

Our example will export spans data simultaneously on `Console` and [arize-phoenix](https://github.com/Arize-ai/phoenix), however you can run your code anywhere and can use any exporter that OpenTelemetry supports.

## Getting Started With Local Development

First, startup the backend as described in the [backend README](./backend/README.md).

Second, run the development server of the frontend as described in the [frontend README](./frontend/README.md).

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

## Getting Started With Docker-Compose

Ensure that Docker is installed and running. Run the command `docker compose up` to spin up services for the frontend, backend, and Phoenix. Once those services are running, open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to use the chat interface. When you're finished, run `docker compose down` to spin down the services.
